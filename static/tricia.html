        She is beautiful. She is smart. She's bashful. Finicky. Very sweet.
        Moody. Diligent. Lazy. Deep. Irritable. Goofy. Definitely attractive.
        Sexy? Could be, but I need time to think about it. Did I already mention
        that she is very very sweet?
      </p>

      <p>
        She's a paradox of perfections and imperfections. She's all the things I
        never knew I wanted.

        There are only so many ways to say that I love you. So I imagine showing
        it would be easier; if only we are near each other. I wanted to show her
        things that she hasn't seen. To make her experience things she hasn't
        done. Cooking for someone isn't really my cup of tea. Getting so
        attached and in love to afford changing schedules just to walk home with
        her. Being worked up with the least of touch, wrinkling a smile with the
        corniest of jokes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can't imagine spending a lifetime with someone other than her. I'm
        sure there are countless other girls I could woo that are smarter,
        sweeter, sexier and have a host of talents that would make the 'single'
        me gasp at the slightest of eye collision. But I choose her. This girl
        who made me feel :)
      </p>

      <p>
        There are only so many ways to say that I love you. I'll use one right
        now.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been saying it all year. I love you baby! Happy 2016! :)
