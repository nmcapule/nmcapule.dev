I'm in the middle of COVID-19 crisis here in the Philippines, with
ECQ-just-turned-MECQ from our _very competent_ government. Might as well use
this time to setup a blog.

```shell
$ NAME="Nats"
$ echo "Let's go $NAME!"
```

SO this is my first post and I'm just testing out Hugo and what's included in
this awesome [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme.

Apparently, I can't create posts with `date` tagged in the future, maybe as a
way for the writer to automatically hide posts until the date has come? I'm not
sure if it's built-in into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or if it's a modification
by my theme.

Anyways, this is pretty cool. Hopefully it reduces enough friction from me
writing a blog post.
