Hi! I'm _Nathaniel M. Capule_, a software developer by trade. I am based in the
Philippines and trying to live out the rest of my professional career as a fully
remote worker.

This is my nth attempt at creating a blogging site. It just happened that I have
come across this awesome Hugo theme called
[**Terminal**](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-terminal/), which fits my
minimalist stylistic preference.

Hopefully, something comes out of this new attempt. Anyways, thanks for dropping
by!
